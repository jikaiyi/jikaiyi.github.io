<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with
<a href="https://leiying.engin.umich.edu">Prof. Lei Ying</a>. 
I received my doctoral degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The Ohio State University under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home">Prof. Yingbin Liang</a>. 
I was a visiting student research collaborator at the department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University working with Prof. H. Vincent Poor. 
Previously I obtained my B.E. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.</p>
<h2>Research </h2>
<p>My major research interest lies in bilevel optimization for modern machine learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the theory side, I focus on new convergence theories for a variety of algorithms such as MAML, ANIL, approximated implicit differentiation (AID) and iterative differention (ITD) based bilevel optimizers, and provide rigorious explaination on exisitng training heuristics for bilevel optimization applications. 
I am also interested in charaterizing the fundamental limitations and optimality for bilevel optimization via developing new lower complexity bounds. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>On the application side, I am interested in developing high-efficiency, scalable, and principled bilevel optimization algorithms for meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization and signal processing.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also worked on the theory and application of gradient-free optimization, large-scale stochastic optimization, and generative models (GANs and VAE). </p>
<h2>News! </h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I am rewarded as expert reviewer and top 10% reviewer for ICML 2021! Really honered! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on bilevel optimization has been accepted by ICML 2021. We provide new and comprehensive nonasympototic analysis for this area. 
We further propose a fast stochastic solver stocBiO with strong performance in applications such as hyperparameter optimization! Check our paper and code!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on theoretical analysis of MAML has been accepted by JMLR 2021 with minor revision.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on generalization error of GANs has been accepted by Trans. on Information Theory (TIT) 2021.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am really honored to receive the 2020/21 Presidential Fellowship at OSU, the highest award for graduate students! I am one of three winners of this award from ECE department this year. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I was awarded as a top 10% high-scoring reviewer for NeurIPS 2020. Thanks!</p>
