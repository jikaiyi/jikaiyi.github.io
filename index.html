<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/">University at Buffalo, The State University of New York</a>. I was a postdoc at <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Lab</a>, <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> from Jul 2016 to Aug 2018, supervised by Prof. Venugopal V. Veeravalli. I completed the Ph.D. degree in <a href="http://eng-cs.syr.edu/our-departments/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> in May, 2016, supervised by Prof. Yingbin Liang. I received the B. E. degree (with honors) from <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2011.</p>
