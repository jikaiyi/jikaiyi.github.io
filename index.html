<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with
<a href="https://leiying.engin.umich.edu">Prof. Lei Ying</a>. 
I received my doctoral degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The Ohio State University in December, 2021, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home">Prof. Yingbin Liang</a>. 
I was a visiting student research collaborator at the department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University working with <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor">Prof. H. Vincent Poor</a>. 
Previously I obtained my B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.</p>
<p><b>I am going to recruit students</b></p>
<h2>Research </h2>
<p>I have been working at the intersection of optimization, machine learning and complex systems, on both the theory and application sides. 
My major research focuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bilevel deep learning (theory, algorithm, and application in autoML, communication networks, database systems, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meta-learning (optimization theory and scalable algorithmic design)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Large-scale optimization (theory and algorithm for big-data applications)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Machine learning for communication and caching networks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>News! </h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Prof. Yingbin Liang (from OSU) and I are organizing an invited session on &ldquo;Bilevel Machine Learning&rdquo; 
for the 2022 Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS) virtually from March 9 to 11, 2022. see <a href="http://ee-ciss.princeton.edu/">&lt;website&gt;</a> for more details. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="12/2021">12/2021</a> Invited talk at the Next Generation Transportation Systems (NGTS) Seminar, University of Michigan. </p>
</li>
<li><p>New manuscript out: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07004.pdf">ES-Based Jacobian Enables Faster Bilevel Optimization</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>We develop a <b>Hessian-free</b> bilevel optimizer building on a Evolution Strategies (ES) based response Jacobian estimator, 
which performs consistently well over various bilevel problems and scales well with large data and deep neural nets.
Check our <a href="https://github.com/sowmaster/esjacobians">&lt;code&gt;</a>!</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>I am honored to receive an <b>outstanding reviewer award</b> from NeurIPS 2021 <b>(top 8% of reviewers)</b>!  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Our recent paper on momentum-based bilevel optimization has been accepted by NeurIPS 2021 with a <b>spotlight</b> presentation <b>(3% acceptance rate)</b>! 
Check our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04692.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JunjieYang97/MRVRBO">code</a>. More results will be added.    </p>
</li>
<li><p>I am rewarded as <b>expert reviewer</b> and <b>top 10% reviewer</b> for ICML 2021 <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/Reviewers">&lt;Link&gt;</a>! Really honered! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on bilevel optimization has been accepted by ICML 2021. We provide new and comprehensive nonasympototic analysis for this area. 
We further propose a fast stochastic solver <b>stocBiO</b> with strong performance in applications such as hyperparameter optimization! Check our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07962">paper</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/JunjieYang97/stocBiO">code</a>!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on theoretical analysis of MAML has been accepted by <b>JMLR 2021</b> with minor revision.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our paper on generalization error of GANs has been accepted by <b>Trans. on Information Theory (TIT) 2021</b>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am really honored to receive the 2020/21 <b>Presidential Fellowship</b> at OSU, the highest award for graduate students! I am one of three winners of this award from ECE department this year. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I was awarded as a top 10% high-scoring reviewer for NeurIPS 2020. Thanks!</p>
